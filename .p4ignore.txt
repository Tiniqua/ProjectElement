# This is a list of files and folders that should not be checked into source control as they are automatically generated by either UE4 or Visual Studio.

# For Perforce to obey this file each person must set an environment variable on their machine. Please do this. These are the steps to follow:

# 1. Open up a Command Prompt.
# 2. Copy (without the quotes) and run this command "p4 set P4IGNORE=.p4ignore.txt"
# 3. You're all done.

# Once these steps are done Perforce will automatically prevent you from adding them to a depot.
